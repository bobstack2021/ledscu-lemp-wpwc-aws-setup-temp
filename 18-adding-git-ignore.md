# We add this file to add a list of files that we don't want to add to the main repo.
# if you try to create this in windows it probably won't work because it starts with a dot so it'll look at it as an empty name so use the touch command and/or certain editors.
# Usually you don't want to include "log files"
# You can also add entire directories by running:
/<directoryName>
# You can also use other expressions such as:
*.txt
# And it'll ignore all .txt files

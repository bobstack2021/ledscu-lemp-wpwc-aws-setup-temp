# Can see home page for "how-to" but did it a different way in this tutorial.
# For other way, go to https://vscodium.com/install
# To install with deb version (best way):
# Go to https://github.com/VSCodium/vscodium/releases
# Can search for the Arch User Repository as well to check and make sure it's there:
# Go to: https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/vscodium/
# See Package details
# Install the Deb Version "amd64.deb" version, which on 02/23/2022 is:
# "codium_1.64.2-1644538525_amd64.deb"
# Make sure to "Save File" instead of saving it in browser.
# Open the terminal 
# Navigate to the "Downloads directory"
# Need to run: 

cd Downloads/
ls
sudo dpkg -i codium_1.64.2-1644538525_amd64.deb
